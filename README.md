# Local-Weather-API
Local Weather API Project

Just a simple web app that displays the local weather depending on your IP and the ability to look for the weather depending on the city.

Using the next technologies:
* [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) which contains dependencies to jQuery + Tether
* [Animate](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) for animations
* [ipinfo.ip](http://ipinfo.io/) - To get IP * doesn't work with some Ad Blockers
* [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) - To work with the weather data (free API)
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete) -  Autocomplete for cities
* [Flags Icons Set](http://365icon.com/icon-styles/ethnic/classic2/)
* [Weather Icons](http://www.123freeicons.com/tick-weather-icons/)
